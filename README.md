**Build Your Own AI App in a Week Workshop**
This repository documents my journey through the "Build Your Own AI App in a Week" workshop, organized by GUVI Geek Networks at IITM Research Park, with the hashtag #LearnWithGUVI. The workshop was an incredible learning experience, covering cutting-edge AI tools, frameworks, and development processes, and it concluded with a rewarding conversation with Mr. Arun Prakash, CEO of GUVI, where I gained valuable insights into the future of AI and technology.

**ðŸš€ Workshop Overview**
Day 1 ðŸŒŸ - Introduction to AI and Generative AI
            Dreamer AI: Experimented with GUVIâ€™s Image Generator Application to create customized images for project use.
Day 2 ðŸŒŸ - Setting Up the Development Environment
           Installed Visual Studio Code for efficient coding.
           Explored Google Colab for cloud-based AI experiments.
           Delved into Streamlit to create interactive web applications using Python.
Day 3 ðŸŒŸ - API Integration and Web Development
           Explored the Streamlit Cheat Sheet to enhance web applications (Cheat Sheet).
           Integrated Gemini API for real-time web applications (API Key).
Day 4 ðŸŒŸ - Project Management and Cloud Hosting
           Created and deployed my own chatbot from scratch.
           Learned GitHub repository management and Render for cloud hosting.
Day 5 ðŸŒŸ - Generative AI Models and Model Deployment
           Explored different Generative AI Models:
             1.Text to Text
             2.Text to Image
             3.Image to Caption
             4.Audio to Text
           Discovered and worked with Hugging Face Transformers (Hugging Face) for deploying pre-trained models.
Day 6 ðŸŒŸ - RAG Architecture and LinkedIn Caption Generator App
           Developed a LinkedIn Caption Generator using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
           Learned how RAG improves AI output by combining generative and retrieval-based models (LinkedIn Captions Generator).
Day 7 ðŸŒŸ - A Conversation with Mr. Arun Prakash
           Had a privileged conversation with Mr. Arun Prakash, CEO of GUVI, where I gained insights into the future of AI and technology.
